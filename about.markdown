-Welcome! I’m Matheus Drumond, a System Developer I with the State of Vermont and a staunch advocate for the transformative power of continuous learning. My career is a testament to my dedication to the ever-evolving field of computer science, where I find joy in unraveling complex problems and delivering robust solutions.

But my pursuits of mastery don’t end with programming. As a devoted Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner and competitor, I embrace the challenges of both the digital and physical realms. This blog is my digital dojo—a space where I chronicle my journey, distill my learnings, and share the wisdom gleaned from both the binary world of computing and the disciplined art of Jiu-Jitsu.

Join me here as I document the paths to mastery in these two dynamic disciplines, reflecting on the lessons learned and the milestones achieved. This is more than just a blog; it's a repository of knowledge, a record of growth, and a testament to the belief that with persistence, practice, and a little bit of grit, we can achieve greatness.
